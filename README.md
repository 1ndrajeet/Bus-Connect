# Bus Pass Management System

## Overview
The **Bus Pass Management System** is an Android application designed to streamline the process of requesting, approving, and managing bus passes. The application uses a PHP-based backend with a MySQL database to handle user data and pass requests. It also includes features for user authentication and admin functionalities to manage requests efficiently.

## Features
- **User Authentication:**
  - Secure user registration and login.
  - Passwords hashed using `bcrypt` for enhanced security.

- **Pass Management:**
  - Users can request new bus passes with specific destinations and payment modes.
  - Passes have expiration dates based on user-selected durations.

- **Admin Panel:**
  - View all pass requests with their statuses.
  - Approve or reject pass requests.

- **Data Management:**
  - View user details and retrieve pass history for specific users.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Android (Java/Kotlin)
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL (MariaDB 10.4.32)
- **API Testing:** Postman

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
1. PHP 8.2.12 or later
2. MySQL 10.4.32 or later
3. Android Studio for building the app
4. Postman for API testing

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1ndrajeet/Bus-Connect
   ```

2. Import the `bus.sql` file into your MySQL database.
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p bus < bus.sql
   ```

3. Configure the backend:
   - Update `conn.php` with your database credentials:
     ```php
     $host = 'localhost';
     $db = 'bus';
     $user = '<your_username>';
     $pass = '<your_password>';
     ```
   - By default user is `root` and password is blank

4. Deploy the backend code to a local or live server.

5. Open the Android project in Android Studio, configure the base URL in the app's API service class, and build the application.
